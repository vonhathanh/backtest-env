    The EventLog is the core of the game's state management system:
    - Maintains ordered sequence of all events
    - Tracks current tick number
    - Provides methods to add events and advance time
    - Handles saving and loading of event history
    - Supports tracking cascades of related events

    The event log can be saved to disk and loaded later to:
    - Restore a game in progress
    - Review game history
    - Debug game state issues
    - Analyze gameplay patterns
    - Trace causality chains between events
